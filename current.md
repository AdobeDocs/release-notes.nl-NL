### New features across [!DNL Advertising Cloud] {#adcloud-all}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Analytics for Advertising Cloud | If your organization wants to switch from using the legacy Adobe Analytics `visitorAPI.js` library to the Adobe Experience Platform library (`alloy.js`) for data collection, you must make changes to enable ID stitching. See [Using the [!DNL Last Event Service] JavaScript Library with Adobe Experience Platform [!DNL Web SDK]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising-cloud/integrations/analytics/planning/web-sdk.html). |

### New features in [!DNL Advertising Cloud DSP] {#adcloud-dsp}

Last updated: **October 27, 2021**

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Custom Reports | You can now create and manage [!DNL Amazon S3] and different types of FTP delivery locations, called *[!DNL report destinations]*, for your custom reports. Once you configure report destinations, you can set up each of your new custom reports to be delivered to one or more locations of a single destination type, or to email recipients. Updates to your [!DNL Amazon S3] and FTP credentials won't interrupt report delivery.<br><br>Your existing reports are still sent to the specified email recipients. To configure delivery to a different report destination, create a report with the new destination. |
| [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views| When you view data for a single day, the trend charts now include hourly data. Hold the cursor over any point to see the data for that hour. |
| [!UICONTROL Placements] | The placement [!UICONTROL Inspector] now includes an [!UICONTROL Inventory] tab, which shows all deals and their associated metrics for the placement. Use the information to make quick adjustments or troubleshoot issues without generating a custom report. |
| [!UICONTROL Ads] | (Users with permission to include Clearcastclock numbers in their ads) DSP no longer shows an error if you use a clock number that's attached to another ad. **Note:**  The best practice is to use a unique clock number for each video ad. Otherwise, the publisher does not approve all the ads. |
| [!UICONTROL Deal IDs] | The [!UICONTROL Deal ID] settings and other places in the user interface reflect new branding for [!DNL Magnite] SSP:<br><ul><li>The SSP [!DNL Tremor] ([!DNL Telaria]) is now [!DNL Magnite CTV].</li><li>In the coming weeks, [!DNL Rubicon] will change to [!DNL Magnite DV+], where [!DNL DV+] stands for display, video, and other formats such as audio.</li></ul> |
| [!DNL Freewheel] programmatically guaranteed deals | You can now find the status of ads for [!DNL Freewheel] programmatically guaranteed deals from the [!UICONTROL Ads] view. Previously, you could check the status only from the [!UICONTROL Deals] view. |
